# Clickrr
Simple C++ console based clicker that will probably even work on 20 yo thinkpad

I created this in less than 20 minutes i guess, this is one of my first game made in cpp that is "success"

nothing really to tell about this

if you're too lazy to compile or you just don't have visual studio i will make Github release every update
